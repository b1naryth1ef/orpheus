# Analytics for Users (https://trello.com/c/4vxZmw6X/46-analytics-for-users)
Stats are fun and graphs are pretty. Let's build a solid set of analytics, stats, and graphs to replace what third-party plugins and tools have done for lounge.

## User Stats
- Historical information on bets, average one
  - Graph of money won/lost over time
  - Graph of net-gain
  - Stats on where this user is in the spectrum of betters based on value placed, bets won/lost
