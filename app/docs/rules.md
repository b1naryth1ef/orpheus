# CSGO Emporium Rules
These rules apply to all entities that use and/or work with us. These rules where written to protect betters, players, teams, and the game as a whole. If you have a question, feel free to contact our support team (csgoemporium AT gmail).

## Bets

### Ownership
When you trade items to be placed in a bet to us, you agree that you've now transferred ownership of the item to the CSGO Emporium entity. We reserve the right to indefinitely hold items transfered to us under any circumstances. Any items returned to the user are soley theirs, and CSGO Emporium takes no responsability for fraud or theft of items after they have left our inventory.

### Value
When your items are traded into our system, we assign a <b>virtual</b> value to them, based on what our internal system has calculated. You agree that this value will be accurate for the duration of our ownership of the item. We reserve the right to <b>without notice</b> modify, reduce, or otherwise change this value.

## Matches

### External Influence (DDOS, etc)
In the case that matches are externally influenced by any individual, we will almost always uphold the match results of the league. CSGO Emporium has a zero-tolerance policy for attacks against matches we host on our website, and any individuals found to be involved with these activities will immediately be banned from our service.

Emporium also believes that it's the full responsibility (in almost every case) of players, teams, their owners and leagues to enact concrete measures to prevent DDOS attacks. We will never hold, return or cancel bets based on external influence which we believe could be avoided through appropriate measures by those entities.

### Forfeit Wins
If games are forfeited, in almost all circumstances Emporium will return all items/bets placed and mark the game as canceled. In some unique situations we reserve the right to uphold the match result if we believe the forfeit was intentionally malicious or intended to disturb the betting process. This rule is not applied to games that fall under the above DOS/Malicious Activity rule set.

### Invalid Results
All returns for match results are held for at least 24 hours within our system. If during that hour we find a match result was entered incorrectly by either one of our admins, or the managing league, we will immediately redraft all items. If we find an error was made after items have been distributed, we will NOT revoke any pending trades, and will make moves to ensuring those that rightfully won items get distributed some winnings (based on availability in our insurance pool)

### Match Throwing
Emporium employs a set of analytical tools we use to detect suspicious or malicious activity by members of matches. If we find any activity that resembles members of either team purposely attempting to effect the fair outcome of the match, we will immediately lock bets pending an internal investigation. Any players found to have purposely thrown or effected match outcome will be banned from CSGO Emporium.

### Other Circumstances
If Emporium ever finds a situation which does not match the rules we've laid out above, we reserve the right to either hold bets pending our investigation and eventual decision, or return bets completely.
