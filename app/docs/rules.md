## Betting

### Placing Bets and Ownership
When initially placing bets, users agree that they are transferring ownership of their items to the CSGO Fort entity. We reserve the right to indefinitely maintain this ownership, and hold items under any circumstances we deem necessary. Users of our site agree that they are legal owners of any items used to place bets on our site.

### Bet and Item Value
Bets are assigned a total value when they are initially placed, based on our internal systems valuation. Users agree that this value is valid for the duration of CSGO Fort's ownership of any and all items. CSGO Fort reserves the right to, without notice, change or adjust this value internally.

## Matches

### External Influence
In any case that CSGO Fort finds external activity was used to influence the results of a match, we will almost always uphold the results returned by the leagues and their managers. CSGO Fort has a zero tolerance policy for attacks against matches, leagues, players, or our website. Any individuals found to be related or participating in these activities will be immediately and permanently removed from our site.

CSGO Fort believes that players, teams and their organizations are responsible for maintaining the integrity of matches. We will never hold, return or cancel bets based on external influence when we believe they could have been avoided through appropriate measures placed by the above entities. CSGO Fort will offer both technical and financial assistance to any players who are being maliciously attacked (DOS, or otherwise). Contact us at contact@csgofort.com for more information.

### Forfeit Wins and Adjusted Results
If games are forfeited by either team, CSGO Fort will return the items/bets placed on the match and mark the game as cancelled (sans situations outlined above in the External Influence section of this document). CSGO Fort reserves the right to uphold match results in these situations if we believe it is necessary to keep the integrity of the match, league, or otherwise. Fort will generally uphold any adjusted results based on rules or otherwise.

### Invalid or Inaccurate Results/Draft
All returns for match results are held within our system for a period of at least 24 hours. If during this time we find that match results where incorrectly entered by our admins or the responsible league, we will immediately redraft all items. We reserve the right to lock match returns for an indefinite period of we believe further investigation or deliberation is required. If the item-lock period has passed when we discover inaccuracies, returns will *NOT* be locked, and we will make our best effort to reimburse or refund users who deserved returns from the changed result.

### Match Throwing and Malicious Activity
CSGO Fort employs a set of analytical tools which constantly analyze risk of matches. If we detect any suspicious or malicious activity by members of teams, organizations, leagues, or otherwise, we will immediately lock relevant matches pending investigation. Any players found to have participated, or had knowledge of any malicious activity will be permanently banned from appearing on CSGO Fort.

### Other Circumstances
If CSGO Fort ever finds a situation which does not match the rules we've laid out above, we reserve the right to either hold bets pending our investigation and eventual decision, or return bets completely.
