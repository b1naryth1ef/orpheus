# CSGO Emporium Frontend

CSGO Emporium is a new automated betting system for the popular Valve game, Counter Strike: Global Offensive (CSGO). We aim to utilize automated bots as fast, reliable, and cheap middlemen to make betting safer and easier!

The frontend (a bit of a misnomer) represents the entire CSGO Emporium web-frontend, including the web _backend_, and the web _frontend_. This project is a pretty common style of flask + raw postgres (no ORM here).

## Development
1. Setup a virtualenv outside this directory (might wanna use [virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/))
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. #shipit
